This is a repository to keep a track of everything that I have done and will be doing for robotics.<br>
In our quest to become self taught roboticists, we need to understand that we will face many ups and downs but giving up is not an option. We will be divide it into 3 categories - Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert.

<h4><b>BEGINNER LEVEL</b></h4>
We will be studying basic mathematics, physics and programming in this level.
<br>Maths -<br>
<ol> <li>Elementary Algebra - HS Hall & SR Knight</li>
<li>Higher Algebra - HS Hall & SR Knight</li>
<li>Trigonometry - SL Loney</li>
</ol>

In Programming, we will cover Python, C and MatLab.<br>
